<p>Professional Journey</p>
<p>Embarking on my career in the meticulous field of dental care, I, Jihee Namgoong, have spent eight years refining my precision and patient management skills in a dental clinic in Korea. Today, I channel that dedication into my role as the Branch Manager at TAMICHI Pearls in Misawa, where the same attention to detail is key to our success.</p>

<p>Artistic and Technical Expertise</p>
<p>My proficiency is not limited to managerial tasks; it flourishes in my hands-on abilities as well. I am deeply passionate about painting and jewelry making, infusing creativity into tangible works of art. Complementing my artistic talents, I possess technical skills in web development, which allow me to merge aesthetic design with digital functionality, enhancing our brand's online presence.</p>

<p>Management and Innovation</p>
<p>Managing TAMICHI Pearls is an exercise in balanceâ€”between the finesse of handcrafted artistry and the precision of strategic business planning. I bring an innovative spirit to our operations, leveraging my web development expertise to improve our digital interfaces, streamline our processes, and captivate our customers both in-store and online. My management philosophy intertwines the beauty of our pearls with the sophistication of modern technology, delivering an exceptional experience that is both seamless and enchanting.</p>
